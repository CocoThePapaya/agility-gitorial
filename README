This is the integration test suite for Hobo.

This test suite depends on [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), [capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) and the selenium drivers for Firefox and for Google Chrome.   It's probably best to install capybara-webkit and [ChromeDriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) manually before attempting to run `bundle install` to ensure that you get your dependencies correct.

Running `bundle update` is not recommended, upgrading capybara often
breaks something somewhere.
